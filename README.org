* Canvas ICS to Org
This is a program that assists in parsing the calendar I get from my school's Canvas page into Emacs org-mode. In order to streamline the process, I use a bash script to curl the calendar into an ics file which I then feed to the python program using command line arguments. See emacs's org-mode for more info!

* Usage Instructions
TBD
